# psy

This is a suite of rRNA related PERL scripts, more or less in CPAN format.  They had all sorts of purposes, most related to the handling and analysis of multiple sequences aligments that contain secondary structure annotations.

# Current state

These were pretty polished a long time ago, but haven't been touched for very long time.  YRMV.

# Acknowledgements

While the coding is @mjy, the inspiration, and real meat behind the biology of the project came from Joe Gillespie.

# Installation

In theory, to install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install
